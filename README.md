# OPCB-221 executables release for Raspberry Pi 3/3B/3B+

OPCB-221 is a device that functions as MODBUS RTU - MODBUS TCP converter. Its
main goal is to connect industrial (MODBUS) equipment to the internet (TCP/IP).

OPCB-221 is used to manage remotely and gather analytics from:

-   HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) reporting for product storage
-   HVAC systems controllers
-   Agricultural smart devices
-   Refrigeration controllers
-   Power network relays, meters and other equipment
-   Industrial IoT devices
-   Industrial sensors and meters
-   Any other MODBUS-compatible electronics

OPCB-221 device can be acquired as a product from
[www.overvis.com](www.overvis.com) or manufactured using any single-board
computer. **This set of files automatically installs OPCB-221 firmware and works
with Raspberry Pi 3/3B/3B+ (Raspbian OS). If you have another board, please
check other branches in this repository.**

OPCB-221 can be used as a stand-alone device, but its main goal is to be
compatible with [Overvis monitoring system.](www.overvis.com) In conjunction
with Overvis OPCB-221 provides:

**Data collection:**

-   Gather operational data points (any numeric values) from your equipment.
-   Store history of operational data, get insights and analytics.
-   Collected data is fully exportable (Excel, CSV).
-   Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point HACCP report.

**SMS and email notifications:**

-   Configure alarms for operational parameters thresholds or connection errors.
-   Set up a “chain of responsibility” requiring alarm confirmations from
    personnel and escalating them on the absence of response.
-   All alarm actions are logged and ready for review.

**Real-time monitoring and control:**

-   Create dashboards with real-time information received from the equipment.
-   Visualize the data using open SVG format.
-   Use Google Maps API to display objects’ locations.
-   Use JavaScript and Overvis API to set up quick action controls for operation
    personnel.

**And more:**

-   Use templates to quickly create devices and alarms.
-   Manage access levels for different accounts inside one organization.
-   Works with dynamic IPs and bypasses firewalls.
-   Optimized mobile access.
-   Industry-standard encryption.
-   Overvis API allows the automation of control and can be used to load data
    into other management systems.
